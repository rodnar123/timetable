# Conflict Logic Analysis and Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Enhanced Conflict Detection Logic**

**Problem**: The conflict detection logic didn't properly handle Joint Sessions and Split Classes scenarios.

**Fix Applied**: 
- Updated `utils/conflictUtils.ts` to include special handling for group scenarios
- Added logic to skip conflicts between slots in the same joint session
- Added logic to skip conflicts between slots in the same split class
- Enhanced faculty and room conflict detection with group-aware logic

### 2. **Joint Session Validation**

**Problem**: Joint sessions could be created with incompatible courses (different year levels, departments).

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced `JointSessionForm.tsx` to validate course compatibility before adding
- Added year level consistency checks
- Added department compatibility warnings
- Updated main application handler to validate courses before creating joint sessions

### 3. **Split Class Group Validation**

**Problem**: Split class groups weren't validated for conflicts with existing classes.

**Fix Applied**:
- Enhanced `SplitClassForm.tsx` to include basic conflict checking hooks
- Added validation logic in the group field update handler

### 4. **Database Schema Consistency**

**Problem**: TimeSlot creation wasn't consistent across different scenarios.

**Fix Applied**:
- Updated the main create handler to include all required fields for group scenarios
- Added `groupType`, `groupName`, and `maxStudents` fields to timeslot creation

## Main Conflict Parameters Maintained

### Core Conflict Rules:
1. **Faculty Conflicts**: Faculty cannot teach multiple classes simultaneously
   - Exception: Joint sessions sharing the same faculty are allowed
   - Enhanced: Different joint sessions with same faculty still conflict

2. **Room Conflicts**: Rooms cannot be double-booked
   - Exception: Joint sessions sharing the same room are allowed
   - Enhanced: Different joint sessions competing for same room still conflict

3. **Student Conflicts**: Students cannot attend multiple classes simultaneously
   - Exception: Split classes divide students, so no conflict
   - Exception: Joint sessions are intentionally scheduled together
   - Enhanced: Year level specific conflict checking

4. **Course Conflicts**: Same course cannot be scheduled twice for same year level
   - Exception: Split classes of same course are allowed (different groups)
   - Enhanced: Year level specific validation

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Fixes:
- Enhanced conflict detection with group awareness
- Joint session course compatibility validation
- Basic split class validation structure
- Updated database creation logic

### ⚠️ Remaining Issues to Address:

1. **Split Class Room Validation**: 
   - Need to validate that split class groups don't conflict with existing non-split classes
   - Requires access to existing time slots in the form validation

2. **Advanced Joint Session Validation**:
   - Should validate that all courses are appropriate for joint teaching
   - Could check course prerequisites, credits, etc.

3. **Conflict Resolution Integration**:
   - The `ConflictResolver` service isn't fully integrated with the new group logic
   - Should update the conflict resolver to handle group scenarios

4. **Real-time Conflict Display**:
   - Forms should show real-time conflict warnings as users select options
   - Need to pass existing time slots to forms for live validation

## Recommended Next Steps

### 1. Complete Split Class Validation
```typescript
// In SplitClassForm, add prop for existing time slots
interface SplitClassFormProps {
  // ... existing props
  existingTimeSlots: TimeSlot[]; // Add this
}

// Use it in updateGroupField to check real conflicts
```

### 2. Enhanced Joint Session Validation
```typescript
// Add more sophisticated course compatibility checks
const validateCourseCompatibility = (courses: Course[]) => {
  // Check prerequisites, credit consistency, etc.
}
```

### 3. Real-time Conflict Integration
```typescript
// Pass conflict checking function to forms
interface FormProps {
  onConflictCheck: (slot: Partial<TimeSlot>) => ConflictCheckResult;
}
```

### 4. Update ConflictResolver Service
- Integrate the new group-aware logic from conflictUtils
- Add specialized resolution suggestions for group scenarios

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Joint Session Creation**:
   - Try creating joint sessions with different year levels (should fail)
   - Try creating joint sessions with same faculty/room (should succeed)
   - Try creating overlapping joint sessions (should conflict)

2. **Test Split Class Creation**:
   - Create split classes with different rooms (should succeed)
   - Try creating split classes that conflict with existing regular classes
   - Verify split classes don't conflict with each other

3. **Test Regular Time Slot Creation**:
   - Try creating regular slots that conflict with joint sessions
   - Try creating regular slots that conflict with split classes
   - Verify normal conflict detection still works

## Key Files Modified

1. **utils/conflictUtils.ts** - Enhanced conflict detection logic
2. **components/modals/forms/JointSessionForm.tsx** - Added course compatibility validation
3. **components/modals/forms/SplitClassForm.tsx** - Added basic conflict checking structure
4. **app/page.tsx** - Updated create handlers for consistency

The implementation now properly handles the core conflict scenarios while maintaining the specific requirements for Joint Sessions and Split Classes. The logic is synchronized across all three functionalities with proper group-aware conflict detection.
